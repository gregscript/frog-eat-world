# Frog Eat World

## Description
Frog Eat World is a game that was developed in the context of a Web Development course within a 5 day timeframe. The goal of the project was to apply and deepen knowledge of OOP and DOM Manipulation to build a working game. No animation libraries were used.

## Instructions to Play
The frog is immersed within a jungle and has only a limited amount of time to eat all the flies it can find. It can move right, left and up with the arrow keys. Jumping sidewards is possible through the space bar.

## Demo
